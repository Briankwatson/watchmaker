# Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I know if watchmaker has installed?

There are several ways to validate that watchmaker has been installed on
your system. You run the command `watchmaker --help` with powershell on
Windows or a bash shell on Linux.


#### What do I do if watchmaker failed to install?

First, review the installation documentation provided with the
watchmaker package. If pip is not working as your primary installation
process you can attempt to install the package by cloning the repo of
watchmaker.
```python setup.py install```


#### How do I know if watchmaker has completed without errors?

The watchmaker process will complete and the system will be rebooted so
the changes can take affect. If this happens watchmaker was executed
entirely. After the reboot, the logs should be checked for errors.


#### What do I do if watchmaker failed to complete or complete with errors?

Start by checking the logs generated by watchmaker, defined by the
argument that was passed to the watchmaker command when executing
`--log-dir=/`. Search the log for entries that have `[ERROR]`, this will
give you a starting point to begin troubleshooting. If its not an
obvious or simple issue feel free to create an issue on the watchmaker
 github page. If there is a salt_call.debug.log in the watchmaker log
directory, you can look for `[ERROR]` messages in there as well.


#### Does watchmaker have Enterprise Linux 7 support?

Watchmaker is supported on EL7; however, there are issues intermittently
with the salt formulas as they are actively being developed.
